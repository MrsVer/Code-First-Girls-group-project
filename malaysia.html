      <h2>Food</h2>
      <p class="lead">Being in south-east Asia, Malysia's food represents just that. It is a melting pot of cultures and that is refelcted in it's food which is influenced by Malay, Indian and Chinese flavours. As a result of historical migrations, colonisation by foreign powers, and its geographical position within its wider home region, Malaysia's culinary style in the present day is primarily a melange of traditions from its Malay, Chinese, Indian, Indonesian and ethnic Bornean citizens, with influences from Thai, Portuguese, Dutch, Arabian cuisines and British cuisines, to name a few. This resulted in a symphony of flavours, making Malaysian cuisine highly complex and diverse.</p>

      <h2>Tourist Spots</h2>
      <p class="lead">Malaysias attraction is as rich and diverse as its culture. Malaysia is a country which is full of natural beauty. It is host to the most beautiful islands, which are found up and down the country. Additionally, Malaysia's rainforests found on Borneo showcase a vast array of biodiversity, where you can find flora and fauna of all kind including the incredible Orang Utans. Malaysia's cities also show off the cultural diversity, where Temples and Mosques provide an insight into the countries history through its stunning architechure.</p>

      <h2>Culture</h2>
      <p class="lead">Malaysia has a multi-ethnic, multicultural, and multilingual society. The culture of Malaysia draws on the varied cultures of the different people of Malaysia. The first people to live in the area were indigenous tribes that still remain; they were followed by the Malays. Chinese and Indian cultural influences made their mark when trade began with those countries, and increased with immigration to Malaysia. Other cultures that heavily influenced that of Malaysia include Persian, Arabic, British. The many different ethnicities that currently exist in Malaysia have their own unique and distinctive cultural identities. Architecture in Malaysia is also a combination of many styles, from Islamic and Chinese styles to those brought by European colonists.</p>
